[SLIDE: Student Dependency Chart] Our survey revealed some interesting perspectives from students regarding their ChatGPT usage. 60% of students acknowledged feeling at least somewhat dependent on ChatGPT for academic work. This raises important questions about long-term skill development that we'll address in our recommendations.

[SLIDE: Academic Confidence Chart] On a positive note, 75% of students reported increased academic confidence after using ChatGPT, with 35% noting significant improvement. This suggests that AI tools may help reduce academic anxiety and improve student self-efficacy.


[SLIDE: Critical Thinking Chart] Students were divided on ChatGPT's impact on critical thinking. 40% believe it enhances these skills, while 25% believe it diminishes them. The largest group—45%—reported no effect. This split highlights the importance of how students integrate AI into their learning process.

[SLIDE: Peer Recommendation Chart] Despite various concerns, an overwhelming 85% would recommend ChatGPT to peers, indicating strong perceived value among students. This widespread endorsement suggests that AI assistance in education is likely here to stay.

## Conclusion

[SLIDE: Conclusion Points] Our research shows ChatGPT has a modest positive impact on GPA for most students, with 65% reporting some improvement. The benefits are most pronounced when ChatGPT is used as a supplement for specific tasks rather than as a replacement for learning.

The impact varies significantly by subject area, with writing-intensive courses and programming classes seeing the greatest advantages. This suggests departments might benefit from tailored approaches to AI integration.

Strategic usage emerged as a key factor in determining outcomes. Students who maintain critical thinking skills and develop verification habits tend to benefit most while minimizing potential downsides.

Balance is crucial going forward. Universities need to address dependency concerns while still allowing students to leverage AI assistance. The goal should be teaching students to use these tools effectively rather than prohibiting them entirely.

## Implications & Recommendations

[SLIDE: Recommendations] Based on our findings, we have recommendations for different stakeholders:

For students: Develop critical verification habits. Don't simply accept ChatGPT's outputs at face value. Cross-reference information, verify with course materials, and use AI as a starting point rather than a final answer.

For educators: Consider guided integration rather than prohibition. Teach students when and how to use AI tools appropriately. Design assignments that leverage AI capabilities while still developing core competencies.

For institutions: Develop nuanced policies that acknowledge both benefits and limitations of AI tools. Focus on teaching digital literacy and AI-augmented research skills as part of the curriculum.

For researchers: We need more extensive studies with larger samples and longitudinal tracking to better understand long-term impacts. Controlled experiments comparing different AI usage patterns could provide valuable insights for optimizing academic outcomes.
