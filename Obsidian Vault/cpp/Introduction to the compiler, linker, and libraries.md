First, the compiler checks your C++ code to make sure it follows the rules of the C++ language. If it does not, the compiler will give you an error (and the corresponding line number) to help pinpoint what needs fixing. The compilation process will also be aborted until the error is fixed.

Second, the compiler translates your C++ code into machine language instructions. These instructions are stored in an intermediate file called anÂ **object file**. The object file also contains metadata that is required or useful in subsequent steps.
