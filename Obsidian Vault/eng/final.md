Dangling and Misplaced Modifiers
- Participial phrases - function as adjectives and are participles (verbs ending in -ing) plus other words
	- Having no GPS, our boat stays close to shore.
- Prepositional phrases - function as adjectives or adverbs, preposition + noun or noun equivalent
    

	- With only one sail, our boat stays close to shore.
    

- Infinitive phrases- as modifiers can function as adjectives or adverbs
    

	- To avoid risk, we sail our boat close to shore.
    

- Subordinate clauses - as modifiers they contain a subject + verb but function as adjectives or adverbs
    

	- Little boats that stay close to shore avoid taking risks.
    

- Misplaced modifiers are not near the word they modify
    

	- Example: I gave a scarf to my friend made of cotton. (Made of cotton
    
	- is close to my friend and seems to be modifying the friend )
    
	- Improved: I gave my friend a scarf made of cotton.
    

- Dangling modifier is one where the word modified is not explicit
    

	- Example: By staying close to shore, the risk of sinking is reduced. (The word
    
	- modified, boat, is not in the sentence.)
    
	- Improved: By staying close to shore, little boats reduce the risk of sinking.
    

- Delayed subject -- it or there is nearest the modifier but is not the word modified
    

	- Example: By staying close to shore, it is possible for little boats to reduce the
    
	- risk of sinking. (It delays the appearance of the subject, boats, and reduces
    
	- the clarity of the meaning.)
    
	- Improved: By staying close to shore, little boats reduce the risk of sinking.
    

- Squinting modifiers
    

	- A modifier caught between two words, either of which might
    
	- be the modified word
    
		- Example: Little boats sailing quickly found tar close to
    
		- shore (Did the boats sail quickly or quickly find tar?)
    
		- Improved: When the little boats sailed near to shore, they
    
		- quickly found tar.
    

- Split infinitives (to + verb)
    

	- A modifier placed between to and the verb
    
		- Example: … to carefully stay close to shore….
    
		- Improved: …to stay carefully close to shore….

## Explanation of Gerunds

---

### When to Use Gerunds
#### 1. **As the Subject of a Sentence**

A gerund can act as the subject of a sentence:

- **Swimming** keeps me healthy.
- **Reading** broadens your mind.

#### 2. **After Certain Verbs**

Some verbs require a gerund as their object, especially verbs of **liking or disliking** (e.g., like, love, enjoy, dislike, hate):

- I enjoy **reading**.
- She dislikes **waiting** in long lines.  
    Refer to a verb list for specific verbs that take gerunds.

#### 3. **After Prepositions**

When a verb follows a preposition, it must be in the gerund form:

- He’s good at **dancing**.
- I’m tired of **waiting**.
- She left without **saying** goodbye.

⚠️ Note: The word "to" can be tricky because it can function as either a preposition or part of the infinitive.

- As a preposition: _I’m looking forward to **meeting** you._
- As part of an infinitive: _I want to **meet** you._

#### 4. **After Phrasal Verbs**

Phrasal verbs are verbs followed by prepositions or adverbs. If a verb follows, it takes the gerund form:

- He gave up **smoking**.
- She went on **talking** despite the interruptions.

#### 5. **After Common Expressions**

Gerunds are used in fixed expressions such as:

- It’s not worth **arguing**.
- Don’t waste time **worrying**.
- He burst out **laughing**.


get used to -> is followed by a noun or gerund (verb + -ing)
**"No use"** is followed by a gerund (verb + ing) when it expresses the idea that something is pointless or futile.



## Infinitive
The **infinitive** is the base form of a verb, usually preceded by the word **"to"** (e.g., to do, to go, to eat). It has various forms and uses, and the explanations provided here cover the different scenarios where the infinitive is used:
### 1. **Basic Infinitive (to do)**
- Used to express actions or intentions.
    - **Example**: _They hope to visit you._  
        The infinitive (to visit) is used to indicate the intention or desire of the subject (they hope).
### 2. **Infinitive with "to be doing" (for continuous action)**
- Used to express an ongoing or continuous action in the present or future.
    - **Example**: _It's nice to be leading such an exciting life._  
        Here, _to be leading_ emphasizes that the action is continuous, referring to the excitement of the lifestyle.
### 3. **Infinitive with "to have done" (for a completed or past action)**
- This form expresses an action that has been completed before the time of speaking.
    - **Example**: _We were sorry to have missed you._  
        The action (missed) is already completed before the time of speaking, so we use _to have missed_ to indicate a past action.
### 4. **Infinitive with "to have been doing" (to stress the frequency or length of the action)**
- Used to express an ongoing action in the past, focusing on how long or how frequently it happened.
    - **Example**: _He appears to have been making phone calls from the office every day._  
        This emphasizes the frequency or ongoing nature of the action in the past.
### **Infinitive with "to" after certain verbs (e.g., ought, have, used, and be able)**
Some verbs require the infinitive with **to** after them.
- **Example**: _She ought to apologize._  
    Certain expressions like _ought to_ and _be able to_ are followed by the infinitive.

### **Position of "not" before "to"**
- When negating the infinitive, **not** comes before **to**.
    - **Example**: _Try not to worry._  
        This shows the intention of avoiding an action, i.e., not worrying.

### **Infinitive without "to" after modal verbs and some other verbs**
- After modal verbs (can, should, would, etc.), the infinitive is used without **to**.
    - **Example**: _He can speak English._  
        _"Can"_ is a modal verb, and it is followed by the base form of the verb (speak), without "to."

### **Infinitive without "to" after verbs like "make," "see," "feel," "let," "watch," "help" (informally)**
- These verbs are followed by the base form of the verb without **to**.
    - **Example**: _I heard her sing beautifully._  
        _"Heard"_ is followed by the base form of the verb (sing), without "to."

### **Infinitive in the passive voice**
- When these verbs are used in the passive voice, the infinitive is followed by **to**.
    - **Example**: _The champion was seen to shake hands with his opponent._  
        This is the passive voice, where "was seen" is used with the infinitive "to shake."
### **Common "It is + adjective + to + infinitive" construction**
- This construction is frequently used to express opinions or feelings about an action.
    - **Example**: _It is difficult to understand what you mean._  
        The adjective (difficult) is followed by the infinitive (to understand) to describe the action.

### **Object + to + infinitive after certain verbs**
- Some verbs (like _want_, _ask_, _tell_, _order_, etc.) require an object followed by the infinitive.
    - **Example**: _I want you to study hard._  
        After the verb "want," we have the object (you) and the infinitive (to study).

### **Infinitive to express purpose (in order to, so as to)**
- The infinitive is often used to express the purpose or intention behind an action.
    - **Example**: _He tiptoed upstairs so as not to wake the children._  
        _"So as not to"_ expresses the purpose or intention (avoiding waking the children).

### **Examples of infinitive without "to" in specific constructions:**
- **"I have work to do."**  
    The infinitive without "to" expresses the necessity or obligation of the action.
- **"Nobody is to blame."**  
    The infinitive without "to" shows that the subject is not responsible for something.
